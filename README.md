# Analysis
Numerical analysis involves a broad range of algorithms and techniques for solving mathematical problems 
This code defines a function bisectionMethod that takes a function func, an interval [a, b], and a tolerance value. It iteratively applies the bisection method until the width of the interval is smaller than the tolerance. Then it returns the approximate root found.
